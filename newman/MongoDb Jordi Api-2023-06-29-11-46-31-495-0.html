This definitely isn&#x27;t the Ritz, and if you&#x27;re looking for a luxury get-away, you&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree. However, if you&#x27;re like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you&#x27;re actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There&#x27;s also cable and internet if you&#x27;re looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors&#x27; TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you&#x27;re like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;8363944&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-10-28T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;7096845&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Jean&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Fantastic location!

It&#x27;s definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It&#x27;s also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn&#x27;t ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option.

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It&#x27;s a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you&#x27;re looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it&#x27;s noisy if you keep the windows open, but that&#x27;s also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t need them (I&#x27;m a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There&#x27;s no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;11063672&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-03-18T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;12932701&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Tami&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill. It&#x27;s close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you&#x27;re looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you&#x27;re looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn&#x27;t be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;11326297&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-03-30T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;5394313&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Christopher&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Our stay here was great and just as we expected!  The apartment was in a really fantastic location and was very convenient.  It is a small, simple, and nice apartment with a cool view.  As a bonus, we talked with some other people that lived there that gave us great pointers about what to do during our stay there.  The included parking was also extremely convenient!

Air conditioning was a nice treat, as was wifi and a parking spot in a secure garage. We chilled out for a day in the unit just watching tv.  The local coffee house next to the IHOP was well worth the wait. David was helpful and responsive to inquiries. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;15837412&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-07-16T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;17333518&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Eric&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;We were really pleased staying at the Waikiki Marina.  The unit is in a great location and has all of the comforts to make staying there a pleasure.  Everything was clean and well maintained and we appreciated the solid wifi access as I had to work part of the time we stayed here.

The secure parking, cable tv and air conditioning unit were a bonus, as was the view! The unit was in a prime location, close to Waikiki and Ala Moana, and really convenient to locate. David was easy to reach and the check-in / check-out process was easy. The unit is also close to major highways so it is easy to get on/off hwy 1. \r\n\r\nBoth elevators were down at one point during our stay, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem - walking up/down was easy (we didn&#x27;t have anything to carry) and one elevator was fixed by the time we got back in the evening. \r\n\r\nDavid, thank you for the stay - it was great! &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;19131965&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-09-07T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;11952818&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Mike&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;David was extremely communicative throughout the entire process. Getting into the room was very simple and parking was a huge plus. The location of the unit is perfect - walking distance from all the Wakiki beaches, restaurants, shops, and ABC stores. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself was a bit run-down. The cabinets and doors felt like they needed an update and the bed wasn&#x27;t the most comfortable. The elevator in the building (our unit was on the 16th floor) was painfully slow but that&#x27;s no fault of David&#x27;s. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a great move over a hotel or something and the price is great.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;20956267&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-10-08T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;20026889&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Kai&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The location was fantastic.  David is very responsive if you have any questions and is accommodating when you have special requests.

The apartment is small but clean. Amenities are basic. The kitchen and the bathroom could use some updates, but everything is functional. Wifi worked perfectly, so no complaint on connectivity. Checking in was very easy. We followed the instruction to get the key and found our parking spot without any problem. The location of the apartment is also very convenient. A few blocks to the beach and choices of restaurants near by. There are less tourists in this part of the town, so it&#x27;s more quite and less crowded&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;23593371&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-12-06T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;1621775&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Silke&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;We had a pleasant stay.

He was very responsive when scheduling the apartment.  Access was incredibly easy as he left the keys in a lock box near the private parking.  Unit was clean, great views of the marina and in the heart of Waikiki.  All of this for under $110/night, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  If ever back in Oahu, I&#x27;ll be sure to reach out to David again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;26470420&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-02-13T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;26499737&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Matthew&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Smooth check in/out.

The unit was as described with all the basic amenities one would need. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better location as you could easily walk to the mall and the park as well as catch the bus for getting around the island. I would happily stay here again should my travels take me back to Honolulu.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;27136069&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-02-26T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;26427652&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Gina&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Very easy to communicate with David in regards to the logistics of checking in, checking out, the lockbox instructions etc. Apartment location was convenient to Waikiki. Included parking was also great. \nThe actual unit itself was very worn out and although I&#x27;m sure it was cleaned, it didn&#x27;t feel too clean because of the amount of wear and tear. \nBut for the price and location, it couldn&#x27;t be beat!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;27507360&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-03-06T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;27664697&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Dan&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Had a great stay.  Felt a lot like a hotel room, which was fine as we had plenty to do out on the town.

Super convenient, parking included, walking distance to plenty of shops, restaurants, bars, and the beach.   The unit is a little dated, but it&#x27;s clean and comfortable.  David&#x27;s instructions were clear and easy on getting into the unit and finding the parking.  The elevators are a bit slow and one of them was always down for service, but that&#x27;s no fault of Davids, just a warning if you are in impatient person.  If you are looking for an affordable place in a very good location check this place out.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;29296049&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-06T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;28683824&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Warren&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Location, location, location.  As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;30307467&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-20T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;29163178&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Paula&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The unit is older and in need of a facelift but it’s got the basics, including a full size fridge, and best of all includes a free designated parking space.  Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.  David was great and yes, the next time we need to visit Waikiki, we’ll book the apt. again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;32681422&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-05-20T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;28796283&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Herve&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Thank you for the Location, the parking space , the Wifi and TV . The communication was either by phone or email and was prompt. It was 5 mins from Ala Moana shopping centre and  5 mins from the beach. it was easy to walk to the Main Waikiki beach even at night. Bus 20 or the trolley was easy to access from the main road and a lot of eating places nearby. The weather was a nice 27 deg with a few showers from time to time and the Circle Island tour from Roberts or  any other tour guide was around $35  and  was worth the price. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;33675716&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-05-31T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;5265153&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Debbie&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This was the perfect location for my trip.

The description and images of the unit are 100% accurate - location is prime! The inclusion of a carpark means we could hire a bike/car and explore the island!

Le check-in est simple et efficace, l&#x27;emplacement est très bon (on peut aller à Waikiki à pied sans problème, mais on évite ici le bruit et l&#x27;agitation du quartier) et la taille de l&#x27;appartement tout à fait satisfaisante pour deux personnes. On oublie rapidement le côté un peu vétuste de l&#x27;immeuble et le bruit de la clim (qui fonctionne très bien pour refroidir la chambre cela dit) en appréciant :\r\n- La propreté du logement\r\n- La vue sur le port et l&#x27;océan \r\n- Tout est fonctionnel, et il y a même quelques objets utiles en plus comme une glacière souple que nous avons pu utiliser pour la plage\r\n- La piscine et le jacuzzi\r\n- La place de parking réservée pour nous\r\n- La rapidité de David pour répondre à nos questions\r\n- La petite supérette ABC store juste au coin de la rue qui dépanne bien en cas de besoin.\r\n\r\nSi nous avons la chance de revenir un jour à Hawaï, ce pourrait être dans ce même logement avec plaisir !\r\n\r\nMahalo :) &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;38303028&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-07-14T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;36012911&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Garret&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Super easy check in and convenient location.

Whether you&#x27;ve got a car, plan to walk, or use public transport, the building was right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. We found the ABC store just beside the building very useful. The AC worked perfectly! Kept us cool and comfortable. \n\nDealing with David was a pleasure. He remained in close communication with us.

The apartment was clean and comfortable.  The only downside of the building was that one of the two elevators was under maintenance during my stay, so getting up and down from the apartment to the ground floor took a little while.

It&#x27;s a 40 story building with 2 elevators.  One had apparently been out of service for a couple of weeks and then the other stopped working.  After a few climbs to the 16th floor at least one was back in service.  Both David and AirBNB were very attentive and I got a partial refund for that day.  \n\nThere is shopping nearby.  Cleanliness was good.  David lives next door and so can be there quickly if needed. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;53135972&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-11-05T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;47026022&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Daniel&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Place was as advertised, clean and tidy, only 5 minutes away from waikiki beach and the Ala Moa shopping centre.

His directions for getting the keys to the condo were easy to follow and we had no trouble.  The room was comfortable and clean but could use some new drapes and carpet. Our only complaint was beyond David&#x27;s control--only one elevator in the building was working so getting up and down was very slow.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;56182071&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-12-10T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;12403444&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Laura&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;A great apartment at a very convenient and quiet location yet walking distance to shopping mall and to Waikiki.  Parking is included which is not so common for most listing. \n\nApartment is simple and cosy. All basic necessities are provided. Feels like home right away. We got lucky with the elevators (unlike most reviews) as both elevators were operating during most part of our stay. \n\nWe had a bathroom crisis in the middle of the night when the flushing tank overflowed and almost flooded. Luckily David took care of it right away in the morning and even cleaned up the affected. \n\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;57005229&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-12-21T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;22221603&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Todd&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;David was easy to communicate with.  The location of the apartment is excellent with regard to Waikiki and the Convention Centre.  Only negative is the rather poor elevator support.  Only one was functioning at the time I was there.

Spent 9 days on Oahu to attend a conference and visit family. If you&#x27;re looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you&#x27;ll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you&#x27;re enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely! Would stay here again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;59991234&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-01-18T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;1479377&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Mark&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The condo was a great deal, centrally located by shops and restaurants in the Ala Moana district. Comfortable bed, AC, a nice shower and plenty of clean towels. Also the parking spot was a huge plus. David&#x27;s directions were clear and accurate and he was very responsive to my questions. I would definitely come back.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;61152426&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-02-01T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;3561883&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Annie&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Le studio est propre et bien situé. Les explications de David pour les clés et le parking étaient très utiles. Les couchers de soleil sont magnifiques du studio! On a aussi profité des serviettes de plages et du parasol qui étaient à notre disposition. Le seul hic? Les ascenseurs!

I give it three stars only because of the problems with the elevator. The one working elevator was broken half the time and incredibly slow the other half. Instead of waiting 30+ minutes (not exaggerating), we went up and down 16 flights of stairs. I felt awful for those on higher floors.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not David&#x27;s fault, but I hope it is fixed soon. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;65138444&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-03-11T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;32991427&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Gilda&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;We stayed for 12 days and rented a car for a week. The parking is already included which is a bonus. The location is close to Ala Moana centre, the beach and convention centre in short, you can go anywhere you want using a bus or a trolley. The place has a comfortable bed and lots of clean towel. The only problem is the elevator because only 1 is working and most of the time it&#x27;s broken. David was kind enough to help us bring down our luggages. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;70789595&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-04-20T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;1130379&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Edward \u0026 Yang Qian&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;With the exception of the lift, the apartment exceeded the description in AirBnB.  The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You&#x27;ll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks).&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;71782191&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-04-28T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;40859330&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Natalie Jane&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This studio is fabulous !

The free parking space is in a secure parking garage and is very handy due to the lack of public parking in the area. The apartment itself is basic, but provides all the necessities and is good for the price. Only downsides are the noise of the AC and the hot water a bit inconsistent at times. David was very responsive to messages and we would highly recommend him as a host.

David was very easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was clean and very functional. The elevator took time, especially at certain times during the day, but overall was not too inconvenient. We were grateful that we were able to park here too.

The flat has a good size, good view, the bed is good and whenever I needed had hot water in the shower. The lift system is undergoing renovation but only once waited for about 5 minutes, the other times I waited for the usual of a building of 40 floors. The parking space is a big deal because in that region the parking is very expensive. The flat is close to restaurants and is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana mall.

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany \u0026 Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you&#x27;re headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge.

The place was not thoroughly cleaned. Everything was dusty or had not wiped down/ cleaned. Appliances were dirty so we did not use them and the sponge in the kitchen had hairs stuck on it. There was also hair on the floor and restroom. I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;244565441&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-03-18T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;172450613&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Amanda&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This is a great little apartment.

It was dirty/sticky and falling apart-litterly doors falling off or missing-pictures are not accurate.. Floors under both sinks is rotten. Bed was horrible to sleep in.

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;357822864&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-12-11T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;222456905&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Shahin&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Great location, an awesome host.

Easy check in-check out procedure. We experienced a elevators failure during Christmas holidays, so no maintenance was available for few days. The apt is on the 16th floor so climbing the stairs (small ramps of 7 steps each though) at least twice a day was quite annoying. The host offered spontanusly 255€ refund for the inconvenience.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;400059558&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-01-10T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;39615383&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Robert&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;David was very helpful and accommodating!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;407326158&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-02-01T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;191075155&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Rhonda&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Great Location!!  Beware of only one working elevator for a 32 story building.  Not sure when the elevator work is going to be completed.  I just used the inconvenience as an opportunity to get my cardio in going up/down 16 flights of stairs each day.  Enjoyed my stay.

You can walk to Waikiki in less than 10 minutes.  You are  on a high floor, and can see the water and the mountains.  It is a good value for this location!&quot;}]}}</code></pre>

When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A\u0026G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn&#x27;t carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;71451096&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-04-25T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10006546&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;13187858&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Dan&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The hosts were very accommodating and agreed to meet with my parents as they were arriving before us.

Wenn es etwas zu beanstanden gab, wird das sofort problemlos erledigt. Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht&#x27;s früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;180030365&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2017-08-09T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10006546&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;25469637&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Mathieu&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Very well located appartement ideal for a family of 5 who want to make the most of the city center.\nIt may be a bit noisy at night but this is acceptable.\nGlobally we recommend this place.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;198679769&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2017-09-30T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10006546&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;21837853&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Ido&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Great location!

The house is NOT WARM and ready for a stay in cold and humit season. There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;232271631&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-02-04T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10006546&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;167219338&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Mérex&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Appartement très cosy!

Ana communicated well regarding check in info, and was even flexible regarding check out timing. The description / pictures are relevant; only the bathroom  is not as recent.

But in warmer months Im sure this isn&#x27;t an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;403055315&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-01-20T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10006546&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;15138940&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Milo&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The house was extremely well located and Ana was able to give us some really great tips on locations to have lunch and eat out. The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn&#x27;t the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.&quot;}]},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;10009999&quot;,&quot;listing_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10009999&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Horto flat with small garden&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;One bedroom + sofa-bed in quiet and bucolic neighbourhood right next to the Botanical Garden.

He&#x27;s a man of his word and very professional.  We highly recommend for everyone to stay in all of the places he recommended.

This definitely isn&#x27;t the Ritz, and if you&#x27;re looking for a luxury get-away, you&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree. However, if you&#x27;re like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you&#x27;re actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There&#x27;s also cable and internet if you&#x27;re looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors&#x27; TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you&#x27;re like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;8363944&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-10-28T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;7096845&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Jean&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Fantastic location!

It&#x27;s definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It&#x27;s also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn&#x27;t ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;9770517&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-01-09T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;2903621&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Tj&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Great location, adequate for a short stay, free parking too!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;10423465&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-02-18T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;11043919&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Rose&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;David was there to meet us as soon as we arrived from the airport and was very friendly.

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It&#x27;s a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you&#x27;re looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it&#x27;s noisy if you keep the windows open, but that&#x27;s also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t need them (I&#x27;m a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There&#x27;s no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;11063672&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-03-18T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;12932701&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Tami&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill. It&#x27;s close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you&#x27;re looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you&#x27;re looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn&#x27;t be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;11326297&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-03-30T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;5394313&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Christopher&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Our stay here was great and just as we expected!

As a bonus, we talked with some other people that lived there that gave us great pointers about what to do during our stay there.  The included parking was also extremely convenient!

David was easy to reach and the check-in / check-out process was easy. The unit is also close to major highways so it is easy to get on/off hwy 1. \r\n\r\nBoth elevators were down at one point during our stay, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem - walking up/down was easy (we didn&#x27;t have anything to carry) and one elevator was fixed by the time we got back in the evening. \r\n\r\nDavid, thank you for the stay - it was great! &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;19131965&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-09-07T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;11952818&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Mike&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;David was extremely communicative throughout the entire process.

The location of the unit is perfect - walking distance from all the Wakiki beaches, restaurants, shops, and ABC stores. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself was a bit run-down. The cabinets and doors felt like they needed an update and the bed wasn&#x27;t the most comfortable. The elevator in the building (our unit was on the 16th floor) was painfully slow but that&#x27;s no fault of David&#x27;s. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a great move over a hotel or something and the price is great.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;20956267&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-10-08T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;20026889&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Kai&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The location was fantastic.

Checking in was very easy. We followed the instruction to get the key and found our parking spot without any problem. The location of the apartment is also very convenient. A few blocks to the beach and choices of restaurants near by.

If ever back in Oahu, I&#x27;ll be sure to reach out to David again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;26470420&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-02-13T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;26499737&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Matthew&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Smooth check in/out.

The unit was as described with all the basic amenities one would need. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better location as you could easily walk to the mall and the park as well as catch the bus for getting around the island. I would happily stay here again should my travels take me back to Honolulu.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;27136069&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-02-26T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;26427652&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Gina&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Very easy to communicate with David in regards to the logistics of checking in, checking out, the lockbox instructions etc. Apartment location was convenient to Waikiki. Included parking was also great. \nThe actual unit itself was very worn out and although I&#x27;m sure it was cleaned, it didn&#x27;t feel too clean because of the amount of wear and tear. \nBut for the price and location, it couldn&#x27;t be beat!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;27507360&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-03-06T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;27664697&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Dan&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Had a great stay.

Super convenient, parking included, walking distance to plenty of shops, restaurants, bars, and the beach.   The unit is a little dated, but it&#x27;s clean and comfortable.  David&#x27;s instructions were clear and easy on getting into the unit and finding the parking.  The elevators are a bit slow and one of them was always down for service, but that&#x27;s no fault of Davids, just a warning if you are in impatient person.  If you are looking for an affordable place in a very good location check this place out.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;29296049&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-06T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;28683824&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Warren&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Location, location, location.  As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;30307467&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-20T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;29163178&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Paula&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The unit is older and in need of a facelift but it’s got the basics, including a full size fridge, and best of all includes a free designated parking space.  Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.  David was great and yes, the next time we need to visit Waikiki, we’ll book the apt. again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;32681422&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-05-20T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;28796283&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Herve&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Thank you for the Location, the parking space , the Wifi and TV . The communication was either by phone or email and was prompt. It was 5 mins from Ala Moana shopping centre and  5 mins from the beach. it was easy to walk to the Main Waikiki beach even at night. Bus 20 or the trolley was easy to access from the main road and a lot of eating places nearby. The weather was a nice 27 deg with a few showers from time to time and the Circle Island tour from Roberts or  any other tour guide was around $35  and  was worth the price. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;33675716&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-05-31T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;5265153&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Debbie&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This was the perfect location for my trip.

The description and images of the unit are 100% accurate - location is prime! The inclusion of a carpark means we could hire a bike/car and explore the island!

Le check-in est simple et efficace, l&#x27;emplacement est très bon (on peut aller à Waikiki à pied sans problème, mais on évite ici le bruit et l&#x27;agitation du quartier) et la taille de l&#x27;appartement tout à fait satisfaisante pour deux personnes. On oublie rapidement le côté un peu vétuste de l&#x27;immeuble et le bruit de la clim (qui fonctionne très bien pour refroidir la chambre cela dit) en appréciant :\r\n- La propreté du logement\r\n- La vue sur le port et l&#x27;océan \r\n- Tout est fonctionnel, et il y a même quelques objets utiles en plus comme une glacière souple que nous avons pu utiliser pour la plage\r\n- La piscine et le jacuzzi\r\n- La place de parking réservée pour nous\r\n- La rapidité de David pour répondre à nos questions\r\n- La petite supérette ABC store juste au coin de la rue qui dépanne bien en cas de besoin.\r\n\r\nSi nous avons la chance de revenir un jour à Hawaï, ce pourrait être dans ce même logement avec plaisir !\r\n\r\nMahalo :) &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;38303028&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-07-14T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;36012911&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Garret&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Super easy check in and convenient location.

Whether you&#x27;ve got a car, plan to walk, or use public transport, the building was right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. We found the ABC store just beside the building very useful. The AC worked perfectly! Kept us cool and comfortable. \n\nDealing with David was a pleasure. He remained in close communication with us.

The apartment was clean and comfortable.  The only downside of the building was that one of the two elevators was under maintenance during my stay, so getting up and down from the apartment to the ground floor took a little while.  But, aside from that one little annoyance, this was a really nice place to stay for a week.

It&#x27;s a 40 story building with 2 elevators.  One had apparently been out of service for a couple of weeks and then the other stopped working.  After a few climbs to the 16th floor at least one was back in service.  Both David and AirBNB were very attentive and I got a partial refund for that day.  \n\nThere is shopping nearby.

If you&#x27;re looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you&#x27;ll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you&#x27;re enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely!

Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You&#x27;ll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks).&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;71782191&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-04-28T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;40859330&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Natalie Jane&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This studio is fabulous !

The free parking space is in a secure parking garage and is very handy due to the lack of public parking in the area. The apartment itself is basic, but provides all the necessities and is good for the price. Only downsides are the noise of the AC and the hot water a bit inconsistent at times. David was very responsive to messages and we would highly recommend him as a host.

David was very easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was clean and very functional. The elevator took time, especially at certain times during the day, but overall was not too inconvenient. We were grateful that we were able to park here too.

The flat has a good size, good view, the bed is good and whenever I needed had hot water in the shower. The lift system is undergoing renovation but only once waited for about 5 minutes, the other times I waited for the usual of a building of 40 floors. The parking space is a big deal because in that region the parking is very expensive. The flat is close to restaurants and is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana mall.

This apartment is right in the heart of it in easy access to all the main Waikiki amenities. Parking on site was great too. Would def stay here again!

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany \u0026 Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you&#x27;re headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;242428030&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-03-11T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;168734883&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Chang Kong&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;We were a little disappointed with the overall stay.  The place was not thoroughly cleaned. Everything was dusty or had not wiped down/ cleaned. Appliances were dirty so we did not use them and the sponge in the kitchen had hairs stuck on it. There was also hair on the floor and restroom. I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;244565441&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-03-18T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;172450613&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Amanda&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This is a great little apartment.

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;357822864&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-12-11T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1001265&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;222456905&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Shahin&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Great location, an awesome host.

The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn&#x27;t meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;6933005&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-08-31T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;6067127&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Nicole&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;I had a wonderful stay at Greta&#x27;s NYC apartment.

Communication was maintained throughout the process and throughout our stay.  She was able to answer any questions we had and even gave suggestions for us.  Her instructions were awesome and the information left at her apartment were great!  There was even a binder with additional information like places to eat and places to go.  She even took the time to make sure we knew how to use the radiator!  Being from Hawaii, we had no knowledge about radiators and how to use them - we really appreciated her thoughtfulness!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;9179262&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-12-11T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;9405167&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Whitney&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta&#x27;s apartment was homey, clean and just the right size for two (probably even three) people. Greta was extremely helpful in getting us settled and providing information about the neighborhood....etc. Murphy bed was very firm but comfortable. Great water pressure in shower. Apt is close to everything and  the neighborhood has so much to offer. I would definitely recommend Greta&#x27;s place.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;9428838&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-12-28T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;10297643&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Deborah \u0026 Tim&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The apartment is very homey - it felt like I was staying in a friend&#x27;s apartment. The bed is surprisingly comfy and firm (I have never slept in a Murphy bed before) and the shower had plenty of hot water and great pressure. Greta was very communicative and friendly, and was also incredibly accommodating when I had something come up unexpectedly and needed to stay a couple hours longer than I anticipated. Overall all it was a very cozy stay in a great location!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;9543118&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-01-02T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;8828184&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Catherine&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;The location of this appartment was ideal! Just minutes away the subway and walking distance from Central Park, Riverside Park, and many good restaurants on Broadway. A quaint appartment, with a lot of cachet.

I plan to stay here next time I bring family to New York. I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;22257920&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-11-02T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;4034556&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Aparna&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta was a lovely host! She was communicative, helpful and flexible during the booking process and very responsive and friendly when we were at her place in NYC. The house is charming and comfortable, and very conveniently located right by the 1 train. We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \r\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay! You can be downtown in 20 minutes. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;23415037&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-11-30T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;22685675&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Karolina&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;I stayed at Greta&#x27;s place for 3 days! It was a really pleasant stay! The bed was really comfortable. The place was clean and cozy. A minute from the subway station! I didnt meet Greta in person, but we were communicating all the time and she was really helpful and kind with everything I needed! I would love to stay again the next time! :) i surely recommend it! &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;23924172&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-12-14T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;16534063&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Paul&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Staying at Greta&#x27;s apartment was delightful!  It&#x27;s a wonderful, quirky New York apartment -- very compact, but also very comfy and accurately portrayed in the pictures.  The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;28737168&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-03-29T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;29115141&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Catherine&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta was a great host.  She met us late on Friday and explained everything about the apartment which we found very comfortable and fun.  I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone.  It is not luxurious but well-equipped and I loved the location, near Central Park and easy walk to museums.\r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;29274122&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-06T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;18417452&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Paul&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Apt is beautifully as advertised, a comfortable place and beds, kitchen and bath. Arrival and departure were really well coordinated by host, the lovely Greta. Location is fabulously convenient on upper West side by subway, Amsterdam and Broadway restaurants, bars and history. We&#x27;d stay here again.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;29610000&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-10T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;27919376&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Anika&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta was a lovely host, making sure we settled in well and could contact her easily if there were any problems. \r\nThe apartment is cosy with very comfortable beds and a well equipped kitchen in case you need a place to cook. It is also a nice neighborhood, with a lot of great places to eat nearby and it is a minute away from a subway station, so you are well connected to the rest of the city. We had a great time! &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;29775810&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-04-12T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;20415509&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Jane&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;My daughter and I stayed the weekend at Gretas place.  Greta was herself away for the weekend but everything was in great shape for us to stay and Greta was very available by phone for any questions.  Everything was very tidy and clean..comfy beds and good shower.  It was like home.  The location in the city is perfect..close to the park and subway.

Here are my reasons:\r\nFirst - she as a person made me feel super welcome. I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn&#x27;t use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;31196460&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-05-03T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;43102&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Catherine Et Albert&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta was a fantastic host, we had a problem with a lost luggage at JFK and she helped us to coordinate the delivery. We also arrived later than scheduled in Manhattan, Greta was waiting for us, she welcomed us very friendly. The apartment is very nice and bright, the bed is very comfortable. Nice building with elevator, perfect location, between Riverside Park and Central Park, a block from the subway, lot of nice restaurants all around, we had a fantastic stay! Greta est une hôte fantastique, nous avons eu un problème de baggage à JFK et Greta nous a aidé à coordonner la livraison.

She took care of the little things that made a difference such as providing an extra set of keys and having the air conditioning on prior to my arrival. The apartment was clean and very comfortable. It instantly felt like \&quot;home\&quot;. The location of the apartment was great! There are multiple grocery stores, restaurants, bars, etc. within a very short walking distance. The subway stop was very conveniently located as was Central Park and Riverside Park, which are both beautiful places for an afternoon walk. I would and have recommended this listing to friends that are traveling to the city and I would stay there again without hesitation. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;37555310&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-07-08T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;6352182&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Murray&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta is an excellent Airbnb host! She is warm, accommodating and very well organized. Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;48783685&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-09-28T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;43967256&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Judy&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;I have used airbnb in NYC several times, and this, by far, was my best experience.  The location is on a quiet street and on the same block as a major subway line.  You can&#x27;t get any better than that.  The apartment has all the conveniences of a home - everything you&#x27;d need in a kitchen, extremely comfortable mattress, cable TV, air conditioning, wifi, great water pressure.  \r\n\r\nGreata goes way out of her way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.  Her recommendations are outstanding and the check-in and check-out were  extremely easy.  This is a five star host and you won&#x27;t go wrong with this choice for a stay in NYC. \r\n&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;53270568&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-11-07T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;21960218&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Nicky&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;This is my second time staying at Greta&#x27;s apartment. The best place to stay in NYC by far. There is a subway on the same street as the apartment, a two minute walk away (the 1 line) and multiple places to eat close by. There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York! &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;57574836&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-12-27T05:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;50466815&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Obaseki&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Greta place is amazing and blissful.

She is an amazing host: disposable, kind and always ready to answer back to our necessities, including late check-in and check-out. The flat itself is a true newyorker&#x27;s one, warm, stylish and excellentlty connected with the subway.

My friend and I slept well in comfortable beds under soft cotton sheets in this lovely quiet flat on the upper west side.  We walked to the Museum of Natural History and hopped on the subway (less than one block away!) to go downtown.

The check in and check out process was easy.  Greta&#x27;s communication was super convenient as she used text messaging and email to keep in constant communication.  Her apartment is beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable, and very welcoming.   The neighborhood is safe with stores and restaurants within a short walking distance.

Greta is a delight and her place is perfect. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is an eat-in and the bathroom is classic New York. The building is almost 150 years old and holds up.

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn&#x27;t leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;98202715&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-08-29T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;20316967&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Jenny&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;We had a wonderful stay in NYC.

Each of the three bedrooms has a door, which is a real treat in a big city! A true New York apartment experience!  Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom&#x27;s use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;156378118&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2017-05-30T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;1003530&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;120945155&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Adrian&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Overall a very nice apartment in a nice location.

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. \n\nThe hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don&#x27;t speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn&#x27;t the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it&#x27;s fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. &quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;105153541&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-09-30T04:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;listing_id&quot;:&quot;10038496&quot;,&quot;reviewer_id&quot;:&quot;81173012&quot;,&quot;reviewer_name&quot;:&quot;Maureen&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:&quot;Ana and Jose were wonderful hosts.

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt&#x27;s clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it&#x27;s an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it&#x27;s only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul.&quot;}]},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;10051164&quot;,&quot;listing_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10051164&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Catete&#x27;s Colonial Big Hause Room B&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;Old floor, intirely reformed, destined to receive people in a very harmonious and welcoming place.

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.&quot;}]},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;10057447&quot;,&quot;listing_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10057447&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Modern Spacious 1 Bedroom Loft&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;Prime location, amazing lighting and no annoying neighbours.
